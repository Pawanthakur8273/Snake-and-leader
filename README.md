# Snake-and-leader
Console Snake Game in C++
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using C++. The game runs in the console and uses basic keyboard inputs for movement.

Features
Grid Size: The game grid is 20x20.
Controls:
W: Move up
A: Move left
S: Move down
D: Move right
X: Exit the game
Score: The player earns 10 points for each fruit consumed.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or its own tail.
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
Compile the code using a C++ compiler, for example:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o snake snake.cpp
Run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./snake
Code Structure
setup(): Initializes the game state, setting the initial position of the snake and the fruit.
draw(): Renders the game board, snake, and fruit on the console.
input(): Handles user input for controlling the snake's movement.
logic(): Updates the game state, including snake movement, collision detection, and score.
Dependencies
This project requires a C++ compiler that supports the <conio.h> header, which is commonly available on Windows. For non-Windows platforms, alternative libraries or modifications might be necessary to handle keyboard input.
